## Feedme Website

Website for building admins of Feedme system. With Feedme we aim to increase the quality of indoor climate in large buildings, such as schools, workplaces or shopping centers. We do this by monitoring and reacting to people's location and personal preferences for indoor climate. This is done through a mobile app which communicates with BLE beacons to anonymously track room location of users and allow them to give feedback on the indoor climate. This website is for administrating the Feedme system and it allows building administrators to add, modify and delete buildings, BLE beacons, rooms etc.
